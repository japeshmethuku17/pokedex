# pokedex
Designing an end-to-end pipeline for classifying a number of pokemons using deep learning.


## Details:
I used PyWebIO to deploy the deep learning based image classification for pokemons. It gives support to flask, django and flask is used for integration in this project.

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repository in your local PC.
2. Install the dependencies as shown in requirements.txt using 'pip install requirements.txt'
3. All the models should be placed in the /models folder. If you wish to replace them with your custom models, place them in the same folder. The models can be found in the Google Drive link (details below).
4. Run the command 'python app.py' from the current working directory (/pokedex).
5. Few sample images have been provided to test the results of classification.
